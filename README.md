Joystick-Controlled-Servo-Blinking-LED
======================================

I have made a joystick controlled servo whose LED blinks when a button is pressed.

I have used one simple void loop for the syntax, in which I have included digtalRead, digitalWrite, and write.

For additional information see my youtube video, which I am currently working on.
